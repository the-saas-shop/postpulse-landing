### 13.4 Class Action Waiver
**YOU AGREE THAT DISPUTES WILL BE RESOLVED THROUGH INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION ONLY, NOT AS A CLASS ACTION, CONSOLIDATED ACTION, OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION.**

- **No Representative Actions:** You may not act as a private attorney general or representative
- **No Consolidation:** Multiple users' claims cannot be consolidated or joined in a single arbitration

**Important:** If the class action waiver is found unenforceable, the entire arbitration agreement (Section 13.2) will be deemed void, and disputes will be resolved in court as specified in Section 13.5.

### 13.5 Judicial Forum and Governing Law (If Arbitration Does Not Apply)
If arbitration does not apply or is deemed unenforceable:

**Governing Law:**
- These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of [STATE], United States, without regard to conflict of law principles

**Exclusive Jurisdiction:**
- You agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in [COUNTY], [STATE]
- You waive any objections to venue or inconvenient forum

### 13.6 Opt-Out of Arbitration

Your opt-out notice must include your name, address, email, and a clear statement that you wish to opt-out of the arbitration agreement. **Opting out does not affect any other terms.**

### 13.7 Severability

The invalid provision will be modified to the minimum extent necessary to make it valid and enforceable while preserving the parties' intent.

### 14.4 Waiver
Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms does not constitute a waiver of that right or provision. Any waiver must be in writing and signed by PostPulse. No waiver of any provision will be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such provision or any other provision.
