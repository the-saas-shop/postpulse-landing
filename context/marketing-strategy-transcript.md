00:00:00.240 Today I sit down with Margot. We will
00:00:02.000 reveal the exact working strategy here
00:00:04.080 that can get a B2B SAS founder those
00:00:06.640 first 100 customers. Margot, you work on
00:00:10.719 go to market strategies with our clients
00:00:12.559 here at SASMaster. You have spent the
00:00:15.120 last eight years helping early stage B2B
00:00:17.680 founders find their first 100 customers.
00:00:20.560 That's your thing. For example, there's
00:00:22.080 one SAS. you you helped scale from
00:00:23.840 $400,000
00:00:25.359 in MR over to $700,000 in monthly
00:00:28.320 recurring revenue in two years. You've
00:00:30.160 worked with companies like uh the
00:00:31.760 infamous SAS group uh scraper API call
00:00:35.520 page and so you've tried it all
00:00:37.520 productled outbound content you know
00:00:40.559 exactly what moves the needle. So Margot
00:00:43.360 let's start with the most common
00:00:45.200 mistakes people make trying to get their
00:00:47.920 first customers. So for you to hit your
00:00:48.000 No text
00:00:50.399 first 100 customers first you need to
00:00:52.879 avoid these three mistakes. So mistake
00:00:55.520 number one uh targeting too bro. If you
00:00:58.320 say we help any business be more
00:01:00.239 productive you've already lost it. Uh
00:01:02.320 because if you target everyone you reach
00:01:04.640 no one.
00:01:05.199 Yeah that makes sense. They're saying
00:01:06.720 don't try to be you know the next Amazon
00:01:08.960 from day one. Uh all countries all types
00:01:11.680 of clients but instead the tool that
00:01:13.920 solves one specific problem for one
00:01:17.119 specific type of customer. Exactly. Now,
00:01:19.759 the second mistake I see founders make
00:01:22.080 is spend 6 months to a year building the
00:01:25.040 perfect product. Uh but they never talk
00:01:26.799 to customers and they basically don't
00:01:28.960 know if people even want this product.
00:01:31.040 So, at the end, they wonder why they got
00:01:33.840 no customers on the launch day because
00:01:36.240 speaking with your real customers is the
00:01:38.880 only way to validate the problem and the
00:01:41.280 market.
00:01:41.759 Yeah, 100%. So you should have proof of
00:01:44.079 interest, you know, whether it's
00:01:45.520 conversations or signups, I guess,
00:01:47.840 right? So mistake number three is
00:01:50.240 generic messaging. If your website says
00:01:52.640 things like we help businesses work
00:01:54.560 smarter or the future of productivity,
00:01:57.040 this basically means nothing.
00:01:58.640 Pretty sure I've seen those,
00:01:59.920 right? Yeah. So it's just generic
00:02:02.159 messaging doesn't directly speak to your
00:02:04.479 customer's pain. And this is why I
00:02:06.479 mentioned that as the first point the
00:02:08.720 messaging has to be a clear promise with
00:02:11.038 proof and why it matters to them.
00:02:13.120 So do you have like a real world fix for
00:02:15.280 that something that used as an example?
00:02:17.120 Yeah, I can give you an example. So for
00:02:18.720 example for an invoicing tool invoice
00:02:21.120 ocean that I've worked for we made an AB
00:02:24.000 test. So we modified the above default
00:02:26.319 area of the page and this was about the
00:02:28.640 headline and a tagline. H to focus on
00:02:31.599 the direct benefit for the users and we
00:02:34.080 structured it in a way generating an
00:02:36.319 invoice in less than 30 seconds and
00:02:38.480 previously uh there had been more
00:02:40.239 generic messaging it was focused on the
00:02:42.160 tool features instead of benefits for
00:02:44.080 users. The result uh after changing
00:02:46.400 those page elements in the copy the
00:02:48.640 conversion rate on the page increased by
00:02:50.879 2.5 times.
00:02:52.239 Wow that's that's actually an impressive
00:02:53.840 result. And so through customer
00:02:55.200 discovery, you know that 30 seconds or
00:02:57.680 less is that pain in creating invoices
00:03:00.080 takes too long. And so uh that messaging
00:03:03.040 is really improved getting customers. So
00:03:05.599 were those the three big mistakes
00:03:08.080 right? Uh they all waste time, resources
00:03:10.959 and delay achieving any kind of
00:03:12.800 momentum. Uh but the good news is if you
00:03:15.360 avoid these three mistakes, you are
00:03:17.120 already ahead of 70% of firsttime SAS
00:03:20.000 funders.
00:03:20.800 So we've avoided those mistakes. How do
00:03:22.000 No text
00:03:22.800 we get our first 10 customers?
00:03:24.480 Okay, so the first 10 customers are the
00:03:26.560 hardest because you have to do things
00:03:28.480 that are not scalable.
00:03:29.760 So for example, like what?
00:03:31.360 So you leverage your network. You start
00:03:33.200 with your network. That's your lowest
00:03:35.360 hanging fruit. You don't need a huge
00:03:37.040 Twitter audience. For SAS businesses,
00:03:39.040 it's better to build a network of other
00:03:41.040 founders and industry experts in
00:03:42.799 communities like uh Microcon connect or
00:03:45.360 the Dynamite Circle. At first, your main
00:03:47.760 task is to have basically conversations.
00:03:50.239 You don't have to do all the selling.
00:03:51.920 Now the goal at this stage is to get
00:03:54.080 into conversations uh and uncover your
00:03:56.879 potential customers challenges. These
00:03:58.799 interactions together with early
00:04:00.720 validation like uh launch list or actual
00:04:04.080 prepayments uh turn into your first set
00:04:06.480 of marketing materials as follows.
00:04:09.040 So basically my first 10 customers are
00:04:11.519 more like my early adopter friends that
00:04:13.840 I talk to a lot who also validate the
00:04:16.000 product pay for it. But uh the currency
00:04:17.519 is not just payment is also feedback.
00:04:19.839 Exactly right. Just a quick thing before
00:04:21.839 we move on. If you're a non-technical
00:04:23.759 founder and you don't want to spend
00:04:25.360 months figuring out MVP validation,
00:04:27.919 developers, marketing, and everything in
00:04:30.000 between, at SASMastery, we've helped
00:04:32.000 over 300 founders launcher MVP
00:04:34.639 profitably. If you'd like that expert
00:04:36.880 shortcut, just hit the first link in the
00:04:39.120 description. All right, back to Margot.
00:04:41.600 Okay, but what happens when your network
00:04:43.919 runs out?
00:04:44.639 Good point. So, that's where the
00:04:45.000 No text
00:04:46.080 repeatable gotomarket strategy comes in.
00:04:48.639 and I'll show you the three outreach
00:04:50.800 tactics that actually work in 2025 and
00:04:53.919 beyond. But before we get to the
00:04:55.919 tactics, you need to nail two
00:04:57.919 foundational pieces first. Now that you
00:05:00.160 had the first a few conversations, we
00:05:02.160 need a repeatable process to find and
00:05:04.639 convert early adopters at scale. This is
00:05:07.199 your core goto market strategy in five
00:05:09.680 steps. First one is defining your ideal
00:05:12.320 customer profile. And I don't mean just
00:05:14.880 like construction businesses. I mean a
00:05:17.120 deep specific definition. Here's what
00:05:19.120 you need to understand. Thermographics.
00:05:21.120 Uh this includes company size, location,
00:05:23.680 tools your ICP uses. Then buyer
00:05:26.160 personas, who has the authority to buy,
00:05:28.400 uh who has influence but not the budget.
00:05:30.639 Then we move to pain points and desires,
00:05:33.039 what keeps them up at night, the main
00:05:34.960 goals, the fears, uh what they are
00:05:36.960 suspicious of, who they see as an enemy.
00:05:39.680 Mhm. So you're basically building a very
00:05:41.440 detailed profile of your customer. And
00:05:44.800 uh because I can already see
00:05:46.320 construction businesses trying to sell
00:05:48.160 to as a SAS selling software to another
00:05:50.400 construction business founder. It's like
00:05:52.080 no that's not an ICP. That's a generic
00:05:54.880 category. You need to be specific than
00:05:57.600 that.
00:05:58.080 Yes. Because when you know exactly who
00:06:00.240 you are talking to, every decision
00:06:02.160 becomes easier. Your messaging, your
00:06:04.720 pricing, your feature prioritization, it
00:06:07.199 all flows from a clear ICP. Your goal is
00:06:09.680 to find the person who is most likely to
00:06:11.680 need, want, and buy your product.
00:06:14.000 Yeah. Uh I would agree. This is also
00:06:15.440 what I've seen from my experience. You
00:06:16.880 know, having a clear ICP defined is what
00:06:19.840 makes your overall marketing sharper.
00:06:21.919 And closely working with those 10 first
00:06:24.160 customers, right? As we said, they're
00:06:26.319 your friends. They're giving you
00:06:27.759 feedback. So, you leverage them as input
00:06:30.800 to now understand, okay, what do those
00:06:32.960 have in common? What do we put into that
00:06:35.199 profile that you just mentioned? Who are
00:06:37.120 they? And that should give you a way to
00:06:40.080 create a clear enough ICP to support
00:06:42.400 your next growth I suppose. So what is
00:06:44.319 step two?
00:06:44.800 Uh step two is when you have the best
00:06:46.800 product in the world but your messaging
00:06:49.280 doesn't resonate. So you have to crowd
00:06:51.360 messaging that speaks directly to your
00:06:53.199 ICP's pain points and then you test it.
00:06:56.479 Try different email subject lines,
00:06:58.639 different headlines and different ad
00:07:00.319 copy. Next start tracking. see how many
00:07:03.360 people are opening, what are they
00:07:05.039 clicking and how do they the
00:07:06.720 conversation start.
00:07:08.240 So you have to iterate the messaging and
00:07:10.560 the copy continuously until you know
00:07:13.039 what works
00:07:13.759 more or less. Yes. And once you find
00:07:16.080 messaging that works uh that's when you
00:07:18.240 scale outreach. So we move to step
00:07:20.960 number three which is focused outreach
00:07:22.720 for early adopters. Now most founders
00:07:25.759 just blast cold emails but that doesn't
00:07:28.000 work anymore because everyone is
00:07:29.440 spamming. So that's why I will share
00:07:32.080 three creative tactics that work way
00:07:34.479 better. And the first one is social
00:07:36.240 engagement. This first strategy entails
00:07:38.800 finding your target personas on LinkedIn
00:07:41.280 or Twitter or other social media
00:07:43.360 channels. Uh you follow them, see what
00:07:45.440 they post, leave comments, like their
00:07:47.520 post. And the main goal here is that
00:07:49.520 they've seen you, which builds trust.
00:07:51.680 You build familiarity before you ever
00:07:53.840 send a DM.
00:07:54.879 You're scaling the first thing, you
00:07:56.800 know, with your network. You were making
00:07:58.479 friends that you already knew and now
00:08:00.639 you're still trying to make friends but
00:08:03.039 now going into a more cold audience.
00:08:06.080 Exactly. And when you do reach out, you
00:08:08.639 are not coming in with a pitch. You can
00:08:10.560 frame it as I've built something for
00:08:12.319 people like you and I'd love your
00:08:13.919 feedback to see if it's actually useful.
00:08:15.919 That angle feels genuine, non-salesy,
00:08:18.479 and gets very high reply rates. Uh
00:08:20.639 you're not a stranger anymore. uh you
00:08:22.479 are someone they've seen in the network
00:08:24.479 and that already puts you ahead of 80%
00:08:27.440 of other founders which then leads us to
00:08:30.000 another element value. Instead of a
00:08:32.320 generic cold email that goes like hello
00:08:34.640 buy my product you give value. You give
00:08:37.039 them something that solves a specific
00:08:38.640 problem they are facing. Maybe make a
00:08:41.120 complete report of their competitors and
00:08:43.360 tell them what they are doing
00:08:44.560 differently and how they can improve as
00:08:46.720 an example. So you're leading with
00:08:48.320 value, not with a pitch, something
00:08:50.240 actionable they can use.
00:08:52.000 Always you are proving you understand
00:08:54.080 their world before you ask for anything.
00:08:56.880 So this third strategy is my favorite.
00:08:59.360 It actually has the highest response
00:09:01.040 rate I've ever seen. Sending interactive
00:09:03.440 video outreach. Uh you can do this on
00:09:05.360 Loom. In this method, you basically
00:09:07.600 create a short four or five minute
00:09:09.680 personalized video message. You use
00:09:11.440 their name. You have their website or
00:09:13.440 their LinkedIn profile on your screen.
00:09:15.440 You explain in 60 seconds exactly how
00:09:18.080 your product helps solve their unique
00:09:19.760 challenge. In a world of thousands of
00:09:22.560 automated text emails, a personal video
00:09:24.720 is impossible to ignore. It adds that
00:09:26.959 human touch. It builds the trust factor
00:09:29.519 almost instantly. It humanizes you. And
00:09:32.560 you've got two quick tips for this. So,
00:09:34.640 first tip I'd like to share is don't use
00:09:37.200 this is bad uh when giving feedback. Use
00:09:39.760 yes and you're collaborating, not
00:09:42.160 criticizing. Uh, and tip number two, if
00:09:45.519 you can find two decision makers at that
00:09:48.240 company, send a personalized video to
00:09:50.320 both of them and mention in each email
00:09:52.640 that you've also sent a video to their
00:09:55.040 colleague. This creates a gossip effect
00:09:57.120 and they will feel more compelled to
00:09:59.360 watch.
00:10:00.000 Oh, that's sneaky. Okay, that makes
00:10:01.920 sense. Uh, this level of personalization
00:10:04.399 makes it very hard to ignore you.
00:10:06.240 Yeah, the video makes you stand out
00:10:08.080 immediately compared to all other guys
00:10:10.000 spamming inbox. The step number four is
00:10:12.959 your landing page as a customer
00:10:14.640 development tool.
00:10:15.680 What do you mean by customer development
00:10:17.440 tool? That sounds very interesting.
00:10:18.880 It means you are using your landing page
00:10:20.959 uh to test ideas before you build. For
00:10:23.040 example, sending mockups to your email
00:10:25.040 list, ask them for feedback and see what
00:10:27.360 they like. And an even more important
00:10:29.440 thing, when your ICP visits a website,
00:10:32.240 uh it should feel like the copy is
00:10:34.000 speaking to them and their exact pain
00:10:35.920 points. It should include social proof
00:10:37.839 and a strong call to action. to the
00:10:39.600 landing page is part of the validation
00:10:42.399 process obviously not just a conversion
00:10:44.720 point
00:10:45.200 of course it's a living document that
00:10:47.120 evolves as you learn more about your
00:10:48.880 customers so next I would suggest you to
00:10:51.360 create a customer feedback loop this is
00:10:53.760 the secret skill that separates good
00:10:55.600 foundaries from great ones you have to
00:10:57.920 obsess over feedback in the starting
00:11:00.079 stages ask what's missing what
00:11:02.160 frustrates them what features they wish
00:11:04.640 existed they will help you way more than
00:11:07.279 you can think in your messaging to
00:11:08.880 attract more clients.
00:11:10.160 Yeah, this is uh crucial indeed. Many
00:11:12.079 founders who run a SAS think they never
00:11:14.399 have to talk to customers. Really,
00:11:16.160 that's why we build software, not run
00:11:18.480 services. But ah that's not really how
00:11:20.720 it works unfortunately. Right.
00:11:22.240 Yeah. Now once you've nailed these five
00:11:24.399 steps, you've got a repeatable process
00:11:26.480 for customer acquisition. But there is
00:11:28.959 one more step scaling beyond the first
00:11:31.680 100 customers which brings us to the
00:11:34.399 most demanding stage of this process.
00:11:36.000 No text
00:11:37.040 So, how do you actually go beyond those
00:11:39.360 first 100 customers? Build a library of
00:11:42.240 success stories. You have to use that to
00:11:44.399 get other clients while you use
00:11:46.079 storytelling in your sales process for
00:11:47.920 more impact. Something like one of our
00:11:49.680 clients in your industry was struggling
00:11:51.600 with the exact same problem. Here is
00:11:53.360 what they did and here is what happened.
00:11:55.680 Instead of our client got to XY Z
00:11:58.480 revenue, the first one basically has
00:12:00.720 more impact.
00:12:01.519 Cool. So you're using your existing
00:12:03.200 customers again to sell to new ones and
00:12:06.720 the insight you got from those.
00:12:08.800 Yeah, social proof is one of the
00:12:10.320 strongest sales tools you have. And the
00:12:12.560 second tactic that I also suggest is
00:12:15.440 building a referral program. You have to
00:12:17.519 make it incredibly easy and offer
00:12:19.360 rewards for your happy customers to
00:12:21.519 bring you new customers. Build it into
00:12:23.680 your onboarding process. Uh you can have
00:12:25.760 an automated email that goes after a few
00:12:27.920 months saying uh love our product share
00:12:30.160 it with a friend and you both get 500
00:12:32.880 bucks. The next one tactic number three
00:12:35.279 position yourself through thought
00:12:36.959 leadership. You need a method that will
00:12:39.120 attract your clients instead of you
00:12:41.519 going to them like you need to position
00:12:43.600 yourself with thought leadership. You're
00:12:45.440 creating top offunnel content tweets
00:12:47.680 posting videos uh short form content
00:12:50.480 etc. Uh, the content should solve ICP's
00:12:53.120 pain points, not just talk about your
00:12:55.120 product. This will build you authority
00:12:57.680 and in the long term get you more
00:12:59.680 clients than you can ever handle.
00:13:01.760 So, posting content is a long-term plan,
00:13:04.240 right? I see a lot of people doing that
00:13:06.240 first or starting to do that right now.
00:13:08.079 That's the long-term plan where you
00:13:10.399 bring down customer acquisition costs
00:13:13.200 because you stop paying or you can't
00:13:15.040 send any more emails because that's
00:13:16.880 getting too much. And this is now the
00:13:19.760 final piece of the strategy, focusing on
00:13:22.000 building a brand rather than conversion.
00:13:24.079 Exactly. It will pay off in the long run
00:13:26.000 No text
00:13:26.000 for sure.
00:13:26.880 All right, that's the playbook for
00:13:28.959 getting your first 100 SAS customers and
00:13:32.320 beyond. So first, avoid the three big
00:13:35.120 mistakes. Targeting too broad, building
00:13:37.440 before validating, and using generic
00:13:40.880 messaging. Then land your first 10
00:13:43.920 customers through real conversations.
00:13:46.079 Network communities, cold DMs. Not
00:13:48.560 selling, just learning and hoping
00:13:50.880 somebody will need what you sell. Next,
00:13:53.360 run the five-step go to market system.
00:13:55.839 Define your ICP, nail your messaging,
00:13:58.800 personalize outreach, optimize your
00:14:00.959 landing page, and keep that customer
00:14:03.920 feedback loop alive, improving each
00:14:07.279 everything with each iteration. And so
00:14:09.440 once that is rolling, scale with proof.
00:14:12.160 Case studies, testimonials, and content
00:14:14.639 that builds authority. Do this right and
00:14:16.800 you'll win your first 100 customers
00:14:19.120 fast. Now, if you're trying to build a
00:14:21.120 SAS, but you're technical, you'll
00:14:22.800 probably spend months trying to figure
00:14:24.480 out everything on your own. At SAS
