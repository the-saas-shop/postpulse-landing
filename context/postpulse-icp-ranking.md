#### Why They Have Highest Intent
- ✅ **Direct Revenue Impact**: More audience = more customers = more money (immediate ROI)
- ✅ **Time = Money**: Every hour on content is an hour NOT selling/delivering
- ✅ **Budget Available**: $19.99/mo is 0.1-1% of monthly revenue (easy yes)
- ✅ **Proven Commitment**: Already building online presence (not just curious)
- ✅ **Fast Decision Makers**: Understand tools, can evaluate quickly

**Headline Test Options**:
1. "Create Authentic X Content in 5 Minutes. Sell More Without Sounding Like AI."
2. "Stop Spending 15 Hours a Week on Content. Start Making More Sales."
3. "Your Voice + Proven Formats = More Customers. In 90% Less Time."

**Social Proof Needed**:
- Testimonial from coach/consultant showing time saved → more client calls

**Pain Points to Emphasize**:
1. Time theft (hours per week saved)
2. Revenue opportunity cost (post consistently = more customers)
3. Authenticity (not generic AI slop)
4. Proven formats (not guessing what works)
